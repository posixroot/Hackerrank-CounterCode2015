 * Problem Statement

        A DOTA game has N heroes, each with a distinct rank from [1..N]. In DOTA every formation is characterized as a permutation [1...N] of ranks of players.
        A formation is Imba when the sum of ranks of every two consecutive players is less than or equal to (N+1). Given N, you are to print the lexicographically smallest permutation of ranks [1...N] that makes the formation Imba.

        Input Format

        The first line will contain an integer T, i.e. the number of the test cases followed by T lines, each containing the value of N.

        Constraints
        1≤T≤5
        2≤N≤105
        Output Format

        T lines each containing the permutation; the numbers in each line should be seperated by a single space.
